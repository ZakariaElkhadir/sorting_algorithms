# Sorting Algorithms in C

This project contains various sorting algorithms implemented in C. You can use these algorithms to sort arrays of elements in ascending order.

## List of Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine. If not, you can install one such as GCC.

### Compilation

Compile the sorting algorithms using the following command:

```bash
gcc -o main main.c bubble_sort.c selection_sort.c insertion_sort.c merge_sort.c quick_sort.c
```

### Usage

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./main
```

You will be prompted to choose a sorting algorithm and input the array to be sorted. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the sorting algorithms:

1. Choose a sorting algorithm from the list.
2. Input the size of the array.
3. Input the elements of the array.

Example:

```plaintext
Choose a sorting algorithm:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

Enter your choice: 1

Enter the size of the array: 5

Enter the elements of the array:
4 2 7 1 5

Sorted array using Bubble Sort: 1 2 4 5 7
```
