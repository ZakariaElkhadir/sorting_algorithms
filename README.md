## Sorting Algorithms and Big O Notation Analysis

# Welcome to Sorting World using C Language

This project is dedicated to showcasing various classic sorting techniques and their corresponding Big O notations, all implemented in the C programming language. Gaining insights into sorting algorithms and their efficiency is fundamental for any computer scientist or developer.

# The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this project:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Radix Sort

# Format used for Quiz and Task questions:
- O(1) (Constant time complexity)
- O(n) (Linear time complexity)
- O(n!) (Factorial time complexity)
- O(n^2) (Quadratic time complexity)
- O(log(n)) (Logarithmic time complexity)
- O(nlog(n)) (Linearithmic time complexity)
- O(n+k) (Linear time complexity with an additional factor)

Happy Sorting :)
